# Building End to End Prices Predictor System â€“ Top 1% Way

### Building an End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline for Price Prediction using ZenML and MLflow

The project is focused on building an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for a **house price prediction system**.

The pipeline is developed using **ZenML, a MLOps framework** that helps in managing machine learning workflows, and **MLflow**, which is used for experiment tracking and model deployment.

The **primary goal** is to predict house prices based on various features of the properties, such as the size, location, and condition.

But everyone is doing house price prediction system, **HOW it will differentiate you?!**
